#Week 5 - JAVA IO-PROGRAMMING
This week, we will explore Java's Input/Output (IO) programming capabilities. Java provides a rich set of classes and interfaces in the `java.io` package to handle various types of input and output operations, including reading from and writing to files, handling streams, and working with data serialization.

### Day 1: Introduction to Java IO and CSV handling of files
- Overview of Java IO package
- Understanding InputStream and OutputStream
- Reading from and writing to files using FileInputStream and FileOutputStream

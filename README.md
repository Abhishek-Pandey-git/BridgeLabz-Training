# Week 5 - JAVA IO-PROGRAMMING
This week, we will explore Java's Input/Output (IO) programming capabilities. Java provides a rich set of classes and interfaces in the `java.io` package to handle various types of input and output operations, including reading from and writing to files, handling streams, and working with data serialization.

### Day 1: Introduction to Java IO and CSV handling of files
- Overview of Java IO package
- Understanding InputStream and OutputStream
- Reading from and writing to files using FileInputStream and FileOutputStream
- Introduction to CSV file format
- Using BufferedReader and BufferedWriter for efficient file operations
- Practical exercise: Reading from and writing to a CSV file
  - OPENCSV library usage for CSV handling

### 27-Jan-2026: JSON Handling and IPL Censor Analyzer
- Reading and parsing JSON files
- Converting Java objects to JSON arrays
- Filtering JSON data based on conditions
- Email validation using JSON Schema and regex
- Merging multiple JSON files
- Converting JSON to XML format
- Converting CSV data to JSON format
- Generating JSON reports from database records
- **IPL Censor Analyzer** - Comprehensive application to censor IPL match data by masking team names and redacting player information in both JSON and CSV formats

> #### JSON Handling Problems:
> 1. ReadJsonFile - Read JSON file and display all keys and values
> 2. ConvertListToJsonArray - Convert list of Java objects to JSON array
> 3. FilterJsonByAge - Filter and print users older than 25 years
> 4. ValidateEmailJson - Validate email fields using regex patterns
> 5. MergeJsonFiles - Merge two JSON files into single JSON object
> 6. ConvertJsonToXml - Convert JSON data to XML format
> 7. ConvertCsvToJson - Convert CSV data into JSON format
> 8. GenerateJsonReport - Generate JSON report from database records
> 9. IPLCensorAnalyzer - Censor IPL match data in JSON and CSV formats

### 28-Jan-2026: Scenario-Based Problems - Annotations, Reflection, CSV and JSON
- Creating custom annotations with retention and target policies
- Using Java Reflection API to scan classes and methods
- Processing annotations at runtime to generate documentation
- Reading and parsing CSV files with BufferedReader
- Converting CSV data to JSON format with proper structure
- Generating JSON audit logs with timestamps
- Implementing audit trail system using annotations

> #### Scenario-Based Problems:
> 1. **HealthCheckPro – API Metadata Validator** - API metadata validator using custom annotations (@PublicAPI, @RequiresAuth) and reflection to scan controller methods and generate documentation
> 2. **MarkMate – Student Marksheet Generator** - CSV to JSON report card generator that reads student marks from CSV, calculates totals, averages, grades and generates JSON report cards
> 3. **EventTracker – Auto Audit System** - Automatic audit logging system using @AuditTrail annotation and reflection to track method calls and generate JSON audit logs with timestamps

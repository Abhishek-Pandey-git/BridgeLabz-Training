### 21-Jan-2026: Java Streams and File I/O
- File Handling with Streams
- Buffered Streams for Performance
- Object Serialization and Deserialization
- ByteArray Streams
- Data Streams for Primitive Types
- Piped Streams for Inter-Thread Communication
- Reading and Processing Large Files
- Word Frequency Analysis

> #### Practice Problems:
> 1. [FileReadWrite.java](https://github.com/Abhishek-Pandey-git/BridgeLabz-Training/blob/java-generics-practice/java-generics-practice/gcr-codebase/genericsPractice/src/com/streams/FileReadWrite.java) - Basic file read and write operations using FileInputStream and FileOutputStream
> 2. [BufferedFileCopy.java](https://github.com/Abhishek-Pandey-git/BridgeLabz-Training/blob/java-generics-practice/java-generics-practice/gcr-codebase/genericsPractice/src/com/streams/BufferedFileCopy.java) - Efficient file copy with performance comparison between buffered and unbuffered streams
> 3. [ConsoleInput.java](https://github.com/Abhishek-Pandey-git/BridgeLabz-Training/blob/java-generics-practice/java-generics-practice/gcr-codebase/genericsPractice/src/com/streams/ConsoleInput.java) - Read user input from console and save to file using BufferedReader
> 4. [EmployeeSerialization.java](https://github.com/Abhishek-Pandey-git/BridgeLabz-Training/blob/java-generics-practice/java-generics-practice/gcr-codebase/genericsPractice/src/com/streams/EmployeeSerialization.java) - Store and retrieve employee objects using object serialization
> 5. [ImageToByteArray.java](https://github.com/Abhishek-Pandey-git/BridgeLabz-Training/blob/java-generics-practice/java-generics-practice/gcr-codebase/genericsPractice/src/com/streams/ImageToByteArray.java) - Convert image files to byte arrays and reconstruct them
> 6. [UpperToLowerCase.java](https://github.com/Abhishek-Pandey-git/BridgeLabz-Training/blob/java-generics-practice/java-generics-practice/gcr-codebase/genericsPractice/src/com/streams/UpperToLowerCase.java) - Convert text file contents from uppercase to lowercase using filter streams
> 7. [StudentData.java](https://github.com/Abhishek-Pandey-git/BridgeLabz-Training/blob/java-generics-practice/java-generics-practice/gcr-codebase/genericsPractice/src/com/streams/StudentData.java) - Store and retrieve primitive data types using DataInputStream and DataOutputStream
> 8. [PipedStreamCommunication.java](https://github.com/Abhishek-Pandey-git/BridgeLabz-Training/blob/java-generics-practice/java-generics-practice/gcr-codebase/genericsPractice/src/com/streams/PipedStreamCommunication.java) - Inter-thread communication using piped streams
> 9. [ReadLargeFile.java](https://github.com/Abhishek-Pandey-git/BridgeLabz-Training/blob/java-generics-practice/java-generics-practice/gcr-codebase/genericsPractice/src/com/streams/ReadLargeFile.java) - Efficiently read large files line by line and filter lines containing specific text
> 10. [WordCounter.java](https://github.com/Abhishek-Pandey-git/BridgeLabz-Training/blob/java-generics-practice/java-generics-practice/gcr-codebase/genericsPractice/src/com/streams/WordCounter.java) - Count word frequency in a file and display top 5 most frequent words
